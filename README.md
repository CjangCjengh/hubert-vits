# Stella VC Based on Soft-VC and VITS

## Introduction

Inspired by [Rcell](https://space.bilibili.com/343303724/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0), I also replaced the `TextEncoder` in VITS with the `ContentEncoder` used in [Soft-VC](https://github.com/bshall/soft-vc) to achieve any-to-one voice conversion with non-parallel data. Of course, any-to-many voice converison is also doable!

With regard to the dataset, I collected about 2000 audio clips from [ピオフィオーレの晩鐘](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/%E8%99%94%E8%AF%9A%E4%B9%8B%E8%8A%B1%E7%9A%84%E6%99%9A%E9%92%9F).
